	<li />Copy all of the files from the installation package into an IIS virtual directory on the server.<br /><br />
	<li />Create a blank database in SQL Server and give it any name.<br /><br />
	<li />Open web.config in the root folder of the application and edit the DatabaseString line.  Change the YOUR_SERVER, YOUR_DATABASE, YOUR_USERNAME, and YOUR_PASSWORD options to match an account that has administration rights to your SQL Server (i.e. the 'sa' account).  This account will only be used during setup to create the tables.<br /><br />
	<li />Open the file setup.aspx by typing http://servername/appname/INSTALL/setup.aspx in a web browser.  If the database and asp.net are set up properly, you should see forms that will allow you to enter your default username/password, choose design templates, and perform other setup actions.  Enter these details and press the final submit button.<br /><br />
	<li />Once the confirmation message appears, open web.config again and change the username/password to those of an account with only read/write privileges.  (Note: you will want to do this so that your web pages are not accessing the database as administrator)<br /><br />
	<li />Click the button on the confirmation page to view the default page of the forums.  Everything should be set up with a few default forums and posts.  You can log in using the administrator username/password you provided to modify the forum colors, layouts, and topics.<br /><br />
	<li />For extra safety you can remove the /INSTALL folder, the /SOURCE folder, and the Setup.dll file from the /bin directory after you have successfully installed the forums.
